OSMNET for reading OSM data from JSON export and plot graph in Matlab

The script make use of the "geoshow" command in the Matlab Mapping toolbox in order to 
handle the WGS84 projection. The "geoshow" can be replaced by standard "plot".


1. Go to http://overpass-turbo.eu and center and zoom the map the 
   the area of interest. Paste the code in the file overpass-turbo-script.txt
   into the Overpass-turbo script window and "Run" the script. 
   If the area is large, the process takes some time. Try with a small 
   area the first time. 

   Look at the data in the "data" tab. Export the data, and select "raw data" as 
   the format. This will save a file called "export.json" in the download directory.
   Move this file to some approprite directory. The format of the file shall be 
   the same as for the "large4.json" file included in this repository.

2. Install the JSON parser from
   http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~kyamagu/software/json/ 
   and make sure that the json.read command is available in order to read JSON 
   into Matlab.

3. Import the JSON data large4.json to Matlab with the command:
   
   X=json.read('C:\approrite directory\large4.json')

   (...or replace with your JSON export file name).

4. Move the osmnet.m to the current directory for Malab and run the osmnet 
   script from Matlab. The nodes and ways data are plotted in a figure, 
   similar to the figure shown in large4.jpg.
